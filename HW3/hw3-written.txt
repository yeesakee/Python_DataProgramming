Answers to the written portion of homework 3

1. a) No I do not think the bar chart from part 1b is an effective data visualization.
      There are only 3 bars and the heights of the bars are very close therefore it gives
      very little information regarding the graph. 
   b) I chose a line graph for part 1c. I thought a line graph would be a good option because
      it helps show the general trends of how the percentage of Hispanic individuals
      with degrees has changed between 1990 and 2010. We are able to see if where the percentage
      may be increasing, decreasing, or staying the same.

2. The limitations to the dataset is that it only includes people from 25 to 29 years old. The
   records only include 1920 to 2018, this dataset cannot be used to compare the later years.
   There is only a set amount of races that is included, and it only includes information of
   people in the U.S.

3. Yes, if the dataset is not updated the predictions will most likely become more and more 
   inaccurate because the data will become old. Because the dataset is separated by race people
   might use the data unethically by comparing different races' the percentages of people receiving degrees.
